Correct! Your UDP packet creation should look something like this:
pkt = IP(dst="127.127.127.127")/UDP(dport=5000)

The host is performing an ARP request. Perhaps we could do a spoof to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack. I think we have some sample scapy traffic scripts that could help you in /home/guest/scripts

Hmmm, looks like the host does a DNS request after you successfully do an ARP spoof. Let's return a DNS response resolving the request to our IP.

Jack Frost must have gotten malware on our host at 10.6.6.35 because we can no longer access it. Try sniffing the eth0 interface using tcpdump -nni eth0 to see if you can view any traffic from that host.

The malware on the host does an HTTP request for a .deb package. Maybe we can get command line access by sending it a command in a customized .deb file

OLD BUSINESS: No Old Business.

RESOLUTIONS:
The board took up final discussions of the plans presented last year for the expansion of Santa’s Castle to include new courtyard, additional floors, elevator, roughly tripling the size of the current castle.  Architect Ms. Pepper reviewed the planned changes and engineering reports. Chairman Frost noted, “These changes will put a heavy toll on the infrastructure of the North Pole.”  Mr. Krampus replied, “The infrastructure has already been expanded to handle it quite easily.”  Chairman Frost then noted, “But the additional traffic will be a burden on local residents.”  Dolly explained traffic projections were all in alignment with existing roadways.  Chairman Frost then exclaimed, “But with all the attention focused on Santa and his castle, how will people ever come to refer to the North Pole as ‘The Frostiest Place on Earth?’”  Mr. In-the-Box pointed out that new tourist-friendly taglines are always under consideration by the North Pole Chamber of Commerce, and are not a matter for this Board.  Mrs. Nature made a motion to approve.  Seconded by Mr. Cornelius.  Tanta Kringle recused herself from the vote given her adoption of Kris Kringle as a son early in his life.

Resolution carries.  Construction approved.

NEW BUSINESS:

Father Time Castle, new oversized furnace to be installed by Heat Miser Furnace, Inc.  Mr. H. Miser described the plan for installing new furnace to replace the faltering one in Mr. Time’s 20,000 sq ft castle. Ms. G. Breaddie pointed out that the proposed new furnace is 900,000,000 BTUs, a figure she considers “incredibly high for a building that size, likely two orders of magnitude too high.  Why, it might burn the whole North Pole down!”  Mr. H. Miser replied with a laugh, “That’s the whole point!”  The board voted unanimously to reject the initial proposal, recommending that Mr. Miser devise a more realistic and safe plan for Mr. Time’s castle heating system.


Motion to adjourn – So moved, Krampus.  Second – Clarice. All in favor – aye. None opposed, although Chairman Frost made another note of his strong disagreement with the approval of the Kringle Castle expansion plan.  Meeting adjourned.
